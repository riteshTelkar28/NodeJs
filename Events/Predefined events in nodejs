Node.js itself provides a number of predefined events through various modules and core functionality. Here are some of the commonly used predefined events in Node.js:

1.  EventEmitter Events : These are events associated with Node.js's `EventEmitter` class, which is the foundation for many event-driven patterns in Node.js.

   - `newListener`: Emitted when a new listener is added.
   - `removeListener`: Emitted when a listener is removed.
   - Custom events: You can define and emit custom events using `emit()` and handle them using `on()` or `addListener()`.

2.  HTTP Server Events : Node.js's built-in `http` module emits events related to HTTP server interactions.

   - `request`: Emitted when an HTTP request is received.
   - `connection`: Emitted when a new TCP stream is established.
   - `close`: Emitted when the server is closed, indicating that it won't accept new connections.

3.  File System (fs) Events : The `fs` module provides events related to file system operations.

   - `change`: Emitted when a file or directory within a watched directory changes.
   - `rename`: Emitted when a file or directory within a watched directory is renamed.

4.  Stream Events : Streams in Node.js emit various events, such as:

   - `data`: Emitted when data is available to read from a readable stream.
   - `end`: Emitted when a readable stream has no more data to provide.
   - `error`: Emitted when an error occurs on a stream.

5.  Child Process Events : Events related to child processes spawned using the `child_process` module.

   - `exit`: Emitted when a child process exits.
   - `error`: Emitted when an error occurs in a child process.

6.  Socket Events : Events related to network socket operations using the `net` or `dgram` modules.

   - `data`: Emitted when data is received on a socket.
   - `connect`: Emitted when a socket successfully connects.
   - `close`: Emitted when a socket is closed.

7.  Timer Events : Events associated with timers created using `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

   - No specific event names, but you can execute code when a timer fires.

8.  Event Loop Events : The Node.js event loop itself emits events, including:

   - `beforeExit`: Emitted before the event loop exits.
   - `uncaughtException`: Emitted when an unhandled exception occurs.
   - `unhandledRejection`: Emitted when an unhandled Promise rejection occurs.

These are just some of the predefined events in Node.js. The events you work with depend on the modules and libraries you use in your Node.js applications. You can also create and use custom events in your applications using the `EventEmitter` class or other event-driven patterns.
